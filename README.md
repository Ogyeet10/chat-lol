> "Turns out vibecoding can actually get you pretty damn far" - *Anonymous Developer, 2025*

## What the hell is this?

A surprisingly decent P2P chat app that somehow works. Built with Next.js, powered by WebRTC, backed by Convex, and made pretty with shadcn/ui. Because sometimes you just need to chat without the corporate overlords watching.

## The Stack

- **Next.js** - Because we're not animals writing raw HTML and JS
- **WebRTC** - For that peer-to-peer goodness
- **Convex** - Our database that actually makes this thing not suck
- **shadcn/ui** - Because Bootstrap UI is what your dad uses

## Features That Actually Work

- Real P2P messaging (no servers reading your shit)
- Looks pretty good (thanks shadcn)
- Actually reliable (thanks Convex)
- Won't make your laptop sound like a jet engine
- Dark mode because we're not monsters

## Getting Started

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-lol.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or if you're fancy
pnpm install

# Set up your Convex stuff
npx convex dev

# Fire it up (it's not that hard to use Next.js guys)
npm run dev
```

Feel free to PR whatever. Just don't break it worse than it already is.

## Known Issues

- Sometimes WebRTC decides to be WebRTC
- Your mom might not understand how to use it
- May cause you to realize your app was designed by a colorblind raccoon

## License

GPL-3.0 - Because sharing is caring, and also legally required now.
